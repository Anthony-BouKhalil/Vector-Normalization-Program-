# Vector-Normalization-Program-
A program that can reads various vectors as input, handles erroneous input, normalizes the vectors and prints them. 
The program terminates when 0 or EOF is entered. 

-A vector is entered by entering an integer indicating its number
of items, followed by at least one space (and possibly more whitespace),
followed by the actual items, followed by <enter>. Vector items are
separated by whitespace (possibly including <enter>).
e.g., the following 2 lines show how the user could input vectors

[ 3.4, 24.8, 8.0, -6, 22 ] and [ 99, 107 ]:
<br />5 3.4 24.8 8.0 -6 22
<br />2 +99 107

-Note that a vector may be split over multiple lines. e.g., a user might
enter vector [33.4, -6, -2, 6] as follows:
 
4 33.4
<br />-6
<br />-2 6
